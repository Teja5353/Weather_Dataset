# Weather Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based weather prediction model. Leveraging historical weather data, the model aims to forecast weather conditions with accuracy. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment steps.

## Features
- Utilizes historical weather data for training and evaluation.
- Implements machine learning algorithms for weather prediction.
- Provides visualization of weather data and model predictions.
- Offers flexibility for users to input new data for prediction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Teja5353/Weather_Dataset.git
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `Weather_Prediction_Model.ipynb`.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions on new weather data.
4. Explore the visualizations to understand the weather patterns and model predictions.

## Files
- `Script.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the weather prediction model implementation.
- `weather_data.csv`: Sample dataset containing historical weather data.
